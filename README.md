The following is a summary of the topics I have read through


Intro to HTML
    
    The topic introduces HTML as one of three web programming languages.
    HTML marks up the contents of a website meaning it informs the browser
    about the various elements on the page without any programming logic
    (e.g loops, if statements or functions).

    HTML code simply declares instructions like 'this is a paragraph' or 'this
    is a link' it archieves this by using tags to mark up different elements.

        comment: I have leant more on some simple tags I have seen before(e.g 
        h1-h6 and p tags) and got introduced to some new tags (eg pre, strong
        cite, and code).

    One the ways to debug an html page is by going to the inspector option




HTML Attributes

    HTML offers additional capabilities throgh the use of attributes.
    Some of the most popular attributes are the id and class attributes.
        
        id attribute uniquely identifies an element and can be used for CSS 
        targetting.
        class attribute groups elements together making it easier for CSS to
        work with them

    There are more HTML attributes some are used to provide browser APIs to
    JavaScript.

    Example of another attribute you can add to an element is ARIA roles.
    ARIA roles are used for people with reading dissabilities where ARIA reads
    out text for them.

        Comment: I have worked a bit with id and class attributes before but
        not extensively. ARIA is new to me and I need to look more into it


HTML Links
    
    When creating links to either other pages or sections you need to use an
    anchor which is the a tag followed by a hypertext refference within which
    is an href tag.

        comment: I have used the a and href tags before but not to any depth
        and the lesson with pathways has taught me how the structure of a 
        project looks and how to link to different files and also learnt
        the differnce between absolute and relative URLs
